# Description of the project 
- HackConnect is a platform that helps college socieities by providing them with an opportunity to collaborate with other college societies as well as companies/orgs
- It also provides a platform for small scale companies to advertise themselves in events such as fests and hackathons
- Not all college socieities have staff/members with all talents, e.g a tech society might not have a good dance team in it
- In such scenarios collaborating with another college society in return for exposition,promotion as well as money is a good option
